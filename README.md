### Setup requirements
- Set up [AUTOMATIC1111's Stable Diffusion AI Web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui).
  - AIYA is currently tested on commit `36c21723b52f17d1de5ff13a50c326c7a0a95285` of the Web UI. 
- Run the Web UI as local host with api (`COMMANDLINE_ARGS= --listen --api`).
- Clone this repo.
- Create a text file in your cloned repo called ".env", formatted like so:
```
# .env
TOKEN = put your bot token here
```
- Run the bot by running launch.bat

#### Notes
- Ensure your bot has `bot` and `application.commands` scopes when inviting to your Discord server, and intents are enabled.
- As /settings can be abused, consider reviewing who can access the command. This can be done through Apps -> Integrations in your Server Settings.
- React to generated images with ‚ùå to delete them.
- Optional .env variables you can set:
```
URL = set URL if yours is not default (http://127.0.0.1:7860) 
DIR = set folder to save images, otherwise the default is \outputs
# only set USER and PASS if you use --share and --gradio-auth
USER = your username
PASS = your password
```
